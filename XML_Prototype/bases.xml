        <title>Coal Plants and Mines</title>
        <description>Coal is a cheap, reliable source of energy. But, many countries
have been scaling down their use of coal power due to its
negative environmental impacts caused by their pollution
emissions.

Advancements in clean coal technolgies may lessen some of
those impacts, but it is likely that coal power will cause acid rain
and leave a large carbon footprint  as long as it is used on a
mass scale.

Investing in Coal Plants & Mines would ensure that this region's
electrical grid needs are affordabley and immediately met for
now but at a steep environmental cost and a continued 
dependency on nonrenewable energy. </description>
